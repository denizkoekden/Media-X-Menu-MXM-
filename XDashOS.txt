Welcome to the first XBOX Open Source Dashboard
This idea was initialy conceved whilst in #xboxopensource and while talking to other developers and users.

The idea of releasing the source for existing dashboards doesnt seem to be the goal for the other major dashboards developers so we decided to make out own (the words dolly, pram and throwing come to mind)

So we have a new dashboard?
In a word, NO, we have only decided to develop one, thats as far as we have got, we have decided on a list of features and they are listed below

What are you going to call the dashboard?
Not sure at this point in time but my initial thoughts are xDashOS

So what are we planning to do?
We Will Try & make a new XBOX dashboard with the following features


Look and Feel of the MicroSoft dashboard 
100% Open Source for an increased development user base 
Set time and Date 
Set ALL video modes (including PAL -> NTSC) 
FTP Client with Resume support 
Built in MP3 audio player 
SNTP and NTP Time Sync Feature 
Save Game Manager 
File Manager 
DVD -> HD Copy 
DVD Player (With remote support)

Do you really think you will be able to add all thouse features to a dashboard?
