Creating multi-game DVD menus using Media X Menu

1. Determine the games that you will be placing onto a single disc, 
   with the total size coming to something under 4.3GB in size.

2. Extract the files using xISO or a similar tool into their own 
   directories (see other tutorials for more details), such that 
   each game has it's own directories.


D:\DNFOREVER
D:\H2
D:\MAME
D:\SPCINVADER3D

   Each game should have an "xbe" file and it's accompanying data files 
   and directories in each subdirectory created.

3. Create you "ISO" directory. this is the directory where you will 
   generate your disc image from:

D:\DVD001

4. Place default.xbe from the MXM binaries in this directory and copy the
   DefaultSkin folder in there as well.

5. In notepad, create a file with the following text:

<Config>
<Main>
<DiscTitle>DVD 001</DiscTitle>
<DiscSubtitle>Collection of games</DiscSubtitle>
</Main>
</Config>

   and save the file to the ISO directory as "MXM.xml" (NOTE: include
   the QUOTES around the filename, so notepad will be forced to place 
   the file correctly; otherwise it may try and name the file as 
   mxm.xml.txt, which would be wrong.

6. In each game directory, put an image named "MXM_SS.xxx" where xxx is 
   the image's extension (JPG, BMP, TGA, GIF, PNG, or WMV) representing
   a screenshot or movie to be displayed for the game in the menu.

7. For each game, using notepad, create the following entries:

<Config>
<Item>
<Title>Game Title</Title>
<Description>Game Description</Description>
</Item>
</Config>

   Common sense says you put the appropriate information in here for each game,
   and save the file to each game directory (after changing the title and 
   description) as "MXM_Entry.xml" NOTE: Again with the quotes!! Force 
   notepad to put the correct extension on it!

8. Now move those game directories into the D:\DVD001 directory you created...

D:\DVD001\
D:\DVD001\DNFOREVER\
D:\DVD001\H2\
D:\DVD001\MAME\
D:\DVD001\SPCINVADER3D\

   ...and you should be ready to build your disc image from the files and 
   directories from D:\DVD001 and below.

9. Create your ISO using GDFIMAGE or IsoMaker or similar tools for XDFS, or 
   simply drag them to Prassi PrimoDVD or RecordNow Max to create a UDF image
   It should look like this:

default.xbe
mxm.xml
\DefaultSkin\
\DNFOREVER\
\H2\
\MAME\
\SPCINVADER3D\

   when the image is build on the disc. Each of the game directories will also 
   have their own MXM_Entry.xml and MXM_SS.* files
